I am a PhD student supervised by [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) and [Justin Solomon](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/). My research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, and computational geometry applied to medical images. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC). During my undergraduate studies, I did research in biomedical signal processing and childhood exercise psychology with [Guy Dumont (UBC)](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~guyd/), particle physics with [Ruediger Picker (TRIUMF)](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=GDnbGPMAAAAJ&hl=en), and medical image analysis with [Jerry Prince (JHU)](http://www.iacl.ece.jhu.edu/index.php/Prince).
